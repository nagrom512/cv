  <p>I am a high school English teacher with fifteen years of experience teaching in public high schools in North Carolina. About five years
    ago, I started to become more involved with leading and creating professional development for the staff at my school. I have always enjoyed
    designing learning activities for my students, but once I started creating lessons for adults, I discovered that I had a passion for adult
    education. In May 2020, I started a master's degree program in Educational Media with a concentration in online learning and professional
    development at Appalachian State University. I finished the program with a 4.0 in just one year. The main reason I was able to finish so
    quickly and successfully is because I was learning how to take my passion for instructional design and adult learning to the next level
    while simultaneously implementing what I was learning in the master's program into my virtual and in-person instruction in the high school
    classroom.</p>
  <p>While completing the master's program in Educational Media, I was given a brief introduction to web development and design. Now that I
    have completed the program, I am adding to my basic knowledge by taking a course in full-stack web development. This website is a result of
    the skills I am learning as I make my way through the course. This website will also serve as a portfolio with examples of my work as an
    instructional designer.</p>
